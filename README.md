# input-tools

A collection of scripts for automating tedious input device interactions

## Auto scroll

To automate scrolling execute the following script:

```sh
./scroll.sh $delay $number_of_activations
```

So, the first argument here is an integer which represents the number of seconds to wait between simulating actions, and the second argument is the number of actions sent each time between the intervals.
